# MacroMate

Materia Raiding priamrily creates and shares macros to allow players to share strats in-game with ease, this allows you to store the strategies in your in-game macro book and use them when needed.
Unfortuantely FF14 has a limit to the total number of macros in-game and storing raid macros in here can take up precious macro slots. 

To resolve this issue, with the help of GrittyFrog you can now sync all the Materia Raiding macros directly into the game with the **Macro Mate** plugin. 
**Macro Mate** is a macro managing plugin that allows you to download and store extra macros in-game. This now also includes syncing raid macros directly from the Materia Raiding website.

## How to setup Macro Mate for Materia Raiding
