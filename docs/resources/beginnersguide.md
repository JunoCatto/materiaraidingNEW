# The Beginners Guide to Raiding

This guide is intended to introduce you to the basics of High-End Duty content in FF14 and is intended for new players who are interested in trying out harder content.

## What is High-End Raiding in FFXIV?

High-End Duty content in Final Fantasy XIV refers to the most challenging instanced encounters in the game, designed for experienced players seeking difficult mechanics and rewarding loot. These duties include:

- **Savage Raids**: Harder versions of normal raids with complex mechanics and strict execution requirements.

- **Extreme Trials**: Tougher versions of standard trials, often featuring unique mechanics and valuable rewards.

- **Ultimate Raids**: The pinnacle of difficulty in FFXIV, requiring near-perfect execution and teamwork.

- **Criterion Dungeons**: High-difficulty dungeon content with unique mechanics and a savage mode for special cosmetics.

- **Unreal Trials**: Revamped versions of older extreme trials, adjusted to modern difficulty standards.
    
- **Chaotic Raids**: Newer large-scale 24 man raids with complex mechanics based on older alliance raids.

These duties typically release in cycles alongside major patches and expansions, offering powerful gear, titles, and cosmetic rewards. 
Players can tackle them via Party Finder or by joining a Static Group, which is a dedicated team that regularly raids together.

### Difficulty

High-End Content varies in difficulty greatly, generally these are ranked as follows from least to most challenging content:

1. Unreal
2. Extreme
3. Chaotic
4. Savage / Criterion
5. Ultimate

::: tip
If you are a new player who has never taken part in High-End Duty, we recommend starting with **Extreme** as this is the best entry point to learn new systems and mechanics in a lower-stress environment.

Extreme trials will introduce you to basics of party roles, mechanics and the terminology used in raiding. This will give you a taste of what to expect in Savage and Ultimate raiding.
:::

::: warning
As Unreal Trials are generally a more seasonal event, these are usually not considered an entry-point for new players getting into raiding and can be heavily cheesed.
:::

### Release Cycle

High-End Duty content in Final Fantasy XIV follows a structured release cycle tied to major patches and expansions. Here's how it typically works:

| Content Type   | Release Cycle                                                                                                        |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Savage Raids   | Released two weeks after a new expansion or major patch, allowing players time to complete the normal version first. |
| Extreme Trials | Usually launched on day one of an expansion or major patch as these are tied to MSQ releases.                        |
| Ultimate Raids | Introduced several months after an expansion or major patch, Typically two ultimates will release per expansion.     |
| Criterion Dungeons | Added in mid-patches, offering a fresh challenge between major content updates. Unpredictable as they were only recently added in Endwalker. |
| Unreal Trials | Updated periodically with most major patches, replacing older trials with revamped versions. |

Savage Raids are the core of FF14 Raiding and release in 3 sets of 4, known as **Tiers**. Each releasing on patch x.0, x.2 and x.4. Each Tier is made up of 4 Trial-like fights where you face off against a single boss. 

### Rewards

High-End Duties in Final Fantasy XIV offer a variety of rewards depending on the type of content. Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown:

- **Unreal, Ultimate and Criterion**: Primarily cosmetic rewards and do not play a part in the gearing of your character.
- **Savage**: Provides the highest-stat gear in the game and tokens that can be used to purchase gear or upgrades for tomestone gear.
- **Extreme**: Rewards weapons that are best for the beginning of a raid tier along with other cosmetic rewards.
- **Chaotic**: Provides strong gear that can be useful in preparing alt jobs for raiding. 

Savage Raids and Extreme Trials are the core of FF14's gearing system, and it is important to know how these work, this will be explained in greater detail further down.

## Finding a Party

There are two ways you can get a party together for High-End Duty content. 

- Form a Static: A group of players who raid together on a regular schedule with the same roster.
- Use Party Finder: Temporary improvised parties formed using the in-game party finder tool.

There are pros and cons to both approaches, this will ultimately depend on your own availability, commitment and goals.

### What is a Static?

A Static is a dedicated group of players who regularly play together to tackle high-end content like Savage Raids, Criterion Dungeons, and Ultimate Raids. Instead of relying on Party Finder, **statics provide a consistent team with established schedules, strategies, and goals**.

Statics are generally only used for the most challenging High-End Duties, as these do require consistency and regular practice to clear reliably. Most Statics will form a few weeks or months prior to the release of a new Savage Raid tier or Ultimate.

A static might follow the regions standard strats or may use their own developed strats for a fight, this will depend on when they progged the fight.

A static is generally considered the **fastest way to clear a tier** and can also guarantee you will get all the loot you need eventually as your team can target loot to players strategically.

::: tip
The best way to find a static is to join your regions party-finder discord servers, for example, we have the [Materia Raiding Discord](https://discord.gg/EySn5dRj65) for the Materia Datacenter.
:::

#### Managing expectations

When setting up a Static, the most important thing to do is to ensure all members have the same expectations for the party. Static groups are generally classified as either Casual, Midcore or Hardcore groups, with vastly different expectations of time commitment, skill level, and work.

Statics often fall apart when groups don't communicate the expectations properly beforehand.

### Party Finder

Party Finder can be a useful tool for finding a group, depending on your region. It allows you to recruit additional players to complete your party or join an existing group for specific content. This system is a great way to participate in raids without committing to a fixed schedule like a static group.

To find the right group, it is important to understand the terminology that is often used for Party Finder listings:

| Terminology        | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Fresh**          | This group is starting the fight or mechanic fresh and is open to unexperienced players                                                                                                 |
| "mech" **Prog**    | This group is currently progging a specific mechanic and looking for other players to also learn this mechanic and prog past it.                                                        |
| "mech" **Cleanup** | This group is looking finish progging a specific mechanic and are looking for players up to the same point in the fight. Do not join if you have not learnt this specific mechanic yet. |
| **A2C**            | This group has progged all the mechanics and are looking for players who are ready to clear the fight, do not join if you are still progging mechanics.                                 |
| **C41/C4x**        | This group is doing a clear of the fight with only 1 or X players who have not cleared before.                                                                                          |
| **Blind**          | This group is not studying the fight and going in without any prior knowledge, let them work it out themselves.                                                                         |
| **Need WM/Macro**  | This group is looking for someone who can bring their own Macros or Waymarks to share with the group                                                                                    |
| **MR Strat**       | This group is using strats specifically from "Materia Raiding" community, this might be replaced with other strat names                                                                 |
| **3x runs**        | This group is looking to kill the boss a certain number of times to farm loot, often seen with extreme trials                                                                           |

::: danger DON'T
Avoid joining a party for content you haven't progressed to yet, as joining groups beyond your current prog point may disrupt others' time and could harm your reputation within the raiding community.
:::

## Preparation

Prior to instancing into a raid, there are several things you need to prepare for - gear, consumables, knowing your class's general rotation and studying for the encounter you intend to do (unless you have joined a "blind" PF or static). 

### Gear and Melding

If you are raiding at the beginning of a tier, you want to be wielding the newest crafted gear that is overmelded with 5 materia. You may have some pieces from the extreme / normal raid and as you obtain tome and raid gear you can replace the lower iLvl piece. You must ensure you gear is fully melded before joining a raid party in PF.

[The Balance Discord](https://discord.com/invite/thebalanceffxiv) will provide you with information on your job's Week 1 BiS, as well as the final raid BiS.

::: tip
BiS or Best-In-Slot gear is the best possible gear you can obtain for your job at a given time. This is usually determined by the community and is often updated with new patches. There are typically multiple BiS sets for a job, depending on the player's preferred GCD timing.
:::

To obtain crafted gear: you can craft it yourself, buy it off the Market Board or have someone else craft it for you.

Overmelding is a process that allows you to add additional materia to your gear beyond the normal limit of 2 and is only available for crafted gear. This is important for maximizing your stats and performance in high-end content for early prog. The first 2 meld slots are guaranteed, but the 3rd, 4th and 5th slots are not guaranteed and can fail.

To overmeld your gear:
- You must have 1 Disciple of the Hand (crafter) job at max level as this allows you to meld your own gear.
- You must complete this [full quest chain](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Forging_the_Spirit) that eventually teaches overmelding.

OR 

- You can borrow the services of a crafter who has already unlocked overmelding themselves. Be sure to give them a tip for their time and effort.

As overmelding gear is a gambling process, you will need a lot of materia. Regularly attending A rank hunt trains (which you can track in the [Faloop Discord](https://discord.com/invite/faloop)) is the best way to obtain clusters (which you exchange for materia). Otherwise, your other immediate option is to buy them from the Market Board which becomes expensive very quickly.

If for some reason you absolutely cannot achieve Week 1 BiS and intend on doing early prog:
- If you are in a static, let them know. How they choose to handle that is up to the static.
- If you intend to PF, please respect other people's time and do not join parties with undergeared and unmelded jobs. People want to give themselves the best chance to progress and having bad gear will undermine that.

If you begin raiding later in the tier, as long as you are fully melded with current tome, crafted or normal raid gear, that is acceptable.

### Consumables

You must have current high quality food up and running during a raid. Food buffs give you extra health and a boost in 2 specific stats - they last 30 minutes (40 with FC buffs and 45 with a manual). The ideal food for your job is information available on The Balance Discord.

You must also carry current high quality potions with you. For extreme and savage, you are not expected to use them during early prog and can save them for final mech prog / A2C / reclears. For ultimates, especially on-content encounters, it is expected that pots are used even during prog at specific points to meet a phase's DPS check. Individual encounters may have unique pot windows but in general, use them when available at the beginning of a 2-minute burst window.

**People can see if you are not using your consumables so don't try to get away with this.**

You can craft these consumables yourself, have someone else craft them for you or buy them from the Market Board.

### Studying

If there are resources available and agreed strategies to solve mechanics for a particular encounter, it is paramount to be familiar with them before instancing into the encounter. Of course, it is normal to make mistakes while practicing physically executing the mechanic, but do not come into raid without having idea what you are supposed to do.

Your static may provide you with the resources you need for studying, but many statics try to match PF strategies for compatability. For PF strategies, the [Materia Raiding Discord](https://discord.gg/EySn5dRj65) has resources including raidplans / toolboxes (visual diagrams of how to resolve a mechanic).

::: warning 
If you are jumping into PF week 1, **expect strats to change multiple times** and regularly check the Materia Raiding Discord until strategies are 100% set in stone.
:::

Studying goes beyond simply looking at raidplans - POVs are essential to put these diagrams into context. Do your best to also understand *why* the mechanic plays out - having a proper understanding of the mechanic (as opposed to looking at the raidplan purely to understand where to stand) will make you a better and more competent raider. As mentioned before, it is disrespectful to other party members and their time to show up underprepared so please study adequately.

How much you need to study depends on the encounter itself or static expectations. Generally speaking, you want to study *at least* 1 phase ahead of your prog point. Again, the definition of a phase will depend on the encounter itself, but just study as much as possible!

The only exception to a study requirement is if you are in a blind PF or static (i.e. the party intends to solve the encounter themselves without any resources)

## How to be a good Raider

Being a good raider is not just about knowing your job and mechanics, but also about being a good team player. This topic will get into some more advanced concepts, terminology and tips that will help you become a better raider.

### Raid Etiquette

- **Be on time**: Arrive at the raid location on time and be ready to start. If you are running late, let your party know as soon as possible.

- **Communicate**: Use voice chat or text chat to communicate with your party. Let them know if you are having trouble with a mechanic or if you need help.

- **Be respectful**: Treat your party members with respect and kindness. Avoid being rude to others. Give everyone a chance to speak and share their thoughts. A healthy atmosphere is important for a successful raid.

- **Evaluate yourself regularly**: If you are consistently causing wipes or falling behind, it may be time to reevaluate your performance and ask for help. If you are not willing to improve, you may be blacklisted from future parties.

- **Be open to feedback**: If someone gives you constructive criticism, take it to heart and try to improve. Everyone makes mistakes, but it's important to learn from them.

- **Avoid getting tilted**: If you are having a bad day or are frustrated with the fight, take a break and come back when you are in a better mindset. Getting tilted can lead to further mistakes and frustration for everyone involved.

In smaller communities, bad behavior can lead to being blacklisted from future parties. Admitting fault and apologizing can go a long way in repairing relationships. If you are blacklisted, it may be difficult to find parties in the future.

### Understanding your Class

text :)

### Reviewing your performance

After each raid, take some time to review your performance. This can help you identify areas where you can improve and become a better raider. Here are some tools you can use to review your performance:

- **Stone, Sky and Sea**: This is a built-in tool in the game that allows you to review your damage performance against a dummy with similar checks to a savage raid fight. if you can kill it, use the time left on the encounter as a gauge of your damage. If you can't kill it, you might need to work on fixing your rotation and burst window usage. If you can effectively pass the SSS trials with plenty time to spare, you are likely ready to tackle the damage requirements for the fight. You can find out how to unlock this content [here](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Stone,_Sky,_Sea).

- **Record Yourself**: Recording your gameplay can help you identify areas where you can improve. You can use software like OBS or Shadowplay to record your gameplay and then review it later.

- **The Balance**: [The Balance Discord](https://discord.com/invite/thebalanceffxiv) is a community of players who share information about job rotations, strategies, and performance analysis. You can ask for help with your rotation or performance in the individual job-specific question channels.

::: warning Third-Party Tools
Some of these tools are considered third-party tools and may violate the Terms of Service of Final Fantasy XIV. Use them at your own discretion.
:::

- **FFLogs**: A popular tool for analyzing raid performance. FFLogs allows you to see in-depth statistics about your performance, key areas to look for are: 
  - rDPS: This is the damage you dealt including all damage due to buffs you provided other players.
  - uptime: This is the amount of time you were able to deal damage during the fight and keep your GCD rolling.

- **Xivanalysis**: A tool that provides detailed analysis of your performance in raids. You can see how you performed in different areas, such as uptime, rotational mistakes, buff usage, and more.

::: warning Note
FFLogs requires someone in the party to be using the ACT (Advanced Combat Tracker) app to export logs and FFLogs Uploader app to upload them. This is not a requirement for all parties, but it is a good idea to ask if you are in a static or log for yourself if you are in a PF.

[How to get started with FFLogs in FFXIV](https://www.fflogs.com/help/start)
:::

### Understanding the Game Systems

Understanding the games engine and combat system can have a large impact on you performance, here are a few key concepts to understand:

- **GCD**: The Global Cooldown is the time it takes for your character to perform an action. Most jobs will run a GCD speed close to the default value of 2.5 seconds, however some jobs either have passive skills or use Skill Speed, Spell Speed or Food to lower this value. Understanding how the GCD works and how to optimize it is crucial for maximizing your damage output.

- **oGCD**: Off Global Cooldown abilities are abilities that do not trigger the GCD and can be used at any time. These abilities can be used to fill the gaps while you wait for the GCS to come back up. Using oGCD abilites between GCDs is called "**Weaving**" and is a key part of maximizing your damage output. You can typically fit 2 oGCDs in between each GCD, but this can vary depending on your job and the abilities you are using. This would be called "**Double Weaving**".

- **Queueing & Clipping**: The game allows you to queue up your next ability while the GCD is still on cooldown. This means you can press your next ability before the GCD is finished, and it will automatically trigger when the GCD is over. The queue window is about 0.5s before the end of the GCD cooldown. This is important for maintaining a smooth rotation and avoiding clipping. The queue is server-side which means that the ability occurs instantly after the GCD finishes which allows you to achieve zero downtime between abilities. Most abilities can be queued however some abilities cannot be queued and will require you to wait for the GCD to finish before using them. The delay that occurs after the GCD finishs and when the next input is registered on the server is called "**Clipping**" and can lead to a loss of damage if not managed properly.

- **Snapshots**: Snapshots is a reference to how the game handles events from the server-side, the game bundles events together every few seconds and processes them as a batch. This can result in some unexpected behaviours when using certain abilites or most commonly when avoiding mechanics. You might visually avoid or dodge a mechanic before the visual indicator ends however if the game has already processed the event, you will still take damage.

Some plugins can assist with common issues with latency and clipping. These can help greatly with tight DPS rotations when you have high ping or are on a low-end PC. These plugins are not required but can help with your performance.

- NoClippy: A plugin that helps with clipping issues by adjusting your GCD and ability timings. This can help you maintain a smoother rotation and avoid clipping abilities on high-latency connections.


## Raiding Concepts

### Phases

Phases are used to describe portions of a fight that have different mechanics or require different strategies. Savage fights will usually only have one phase except the last fight of a tier, which will have 2 distinct phases. Ultimate raids will generally have 5-6 phases, with each phase being like a mini-savage in itself.

Some raids will have a checkpoint where you can wipe and start future pulls from a later phase. These are most common in the last fight of a savage tier.

Phases are helpful for breaking down a fight into manageable chunks and allow you to focus on one part of the fight at a time. This is especially useful for new players who may be overwhelmed by the number of mechanics in a fight. 

### Burst/Pot Windows

Burst window is a term commonly used to refer to a period of time when the party aligns party buffs and cooldowns for maximum damage output. This is usually done at the start of a fight and at regular 2-minute intervals throughout the encounter. Some jobs will also have a 1-minute burst window but these are generally handled automatically between the 2-minute windows. 

To get the most damage out of your job, you may hold some cooldowns to ensure they align for an upcoming burst window.

2-minute burst windows may be deliberately delayed to align with downtime or other mechanics, it is important to communicate with your party about when these windows will occur.

Potions (Pots) will typically be used in line with the first burst window and the subsequent usages will be delayed to align with another burst window later in the fight, it is important to discuss this with your party to ensure these are used correctly. Most savage raids will get at least 2 pot windows, with some fights having 3. Ultimate fights are significantly longer and will have even more pot windows.

### DPS Checks & Enrage

DPS checks are points in a fight where the party must deal a certain amount of damage or reach a certain boss health percentage within a specific time frame to avoid a wipe. These checks can be triggered by mechanics or boss abilities, and they often require the party to use their burst windows and potions effectively.

The most common form of DPS check will be the enrage for a fight where the boss will enrage and wipe the party if they do not defeat the boss before enrage. Ultimate fights will often have multiple DPS checks throughout the fight that must be met to progress through the fight or into the next phase.

### Mitigations (Mits)

Damage mitigation is a crucial aspect of high-end raiding, as it helps reduce the amount of damage taken by the party during encounters. This can be achieved through various means, including:

- **Tank cooldowns**: Tanks have a variety of abilities that can reduce damage taken by themselves and the party. These should be used strategically during high-damage phases or mechanics. Tanks will also need to coordinate their mitigations to deal with tank busters and other mechanics that require them to take significant damage.

- **Healer cooldowns**: Healers have abilities that can mitigate damage for the party, such as shields or healing over time effects. These should be used in conjunction with tank cooldowns to ensure the party stays alive during difficult mechanics. Shield healers have the most defensive mitigations but all healers have some tools to help mitigate damage.

- **Feint/Addle**: Certain DPS roles have abilities that can reduce damage dealt by the target, such as Feint or Addle. These should be used strategically during high-damage phases or mechanics. Feint reduces outgoing physical damage by 10% and magic damage by 5% for 10 seconds. Addle reduces magic damage by 10% and physical damage by 5% for 10 seconds. This should be coordinated with your DPS to ensure these do not overlap.

A Mit-plan is a plan that outlines when and how to use damage mitigation abilities during a fight. This can help ensure that the party is prepared for high-damage phases and can survive difficult mechanics. This can vary greatly with party composition and the fight itself, so it is important to discuss this with your party before the fight begins.

::: tip
**FFXIV Fight Line** is a great tool for creating a Mit-plan for your party. It allows you to create a timeline of the fight with premade templates of existing encounters. This can help ensure that everyone is on the same page and knows when to use their cooldowns.

### Macros

Macros are a way to automate certain actions in the game, such as using items or abilities. They are also often used to quickly share information with the party, such as strats. In Materia it is common practice to share a macro with the party at the start of a session to explain the strats the party plans to use.

Macros are provided by Materia Raiding for all current raids.

### Waymarks

Waymarks are markers that can be placed on the ground to help players navigate and position themselves during encounters. They are often used in conjunction with macros to provide visual cues for mechanics or party positioning.

Waymarks are generally specific to a strategy and are generally provided alongside other resources such as in the raid guides provided by Materia Raiding.

![](/images/ex1-waymarks.webp)

These waymarks can be imported into the game using the Waymark Import addon, or you can ask a friend to import them for you and save a copy for yourself.

### Role Positions

There are a handful of default positions and groups assigned to each role in a raid that are commonly used across many mechanics, knowing these can help you understand a wide variety of mechanics without having to learn them all individually.

#### Light Parties

Light parties are a way to describe the position of players in relation to two separate groups. This is commonly used in mechanics where the party must be split in half to perform a mechanic, the default light parties are:

- Light Party 1 (LP1): MT H1 D1 D3
- Light Party 2 (LP2): ST H2 D2 D4

#### Clock Spots

Clock spots are a way to describe the position of players in relation to a clock face. This is often used in mechanics where players need to spread out or stack together. The default clock spots are:

![](/images/beginnersguide-defaultpositions.webp)

These positions are in relation to the default clock-spot waymarks. These are use commonly and are a great way to also start blind-prog in any fight. All raiders should be aware of their default clock spots.

::: warning IMPORTANT
Beware there are variations of these positions for some fights due to specific mechanics, such as FRU where ST and H2 positions are swapped. It is important to check the fight guide for any specific changes to these positions.
:::

#### Color Partners

As an extension of clock spots, color partners are a way to describe the position of players in relation to each other. This is often used in mechanics where players need to spread out or stack together. The default color partners are based on you clock spots and the waymarks which are in the same positions (colors).

As per the image above, you will notice H1 and D1 are both in line with a Purple waymarks, this means they are color partners and will use these pairs for various mechanics.

- Red: MT D3
- Yellow: H2 D4
- Blue: ST D2
- Purple: H1 D1

## Rewards

Many loot rewards from various battle content have weekly limits. For reference, these weekly limits reset every Tuesday UTC+00:00 (18:00 AEST | 19:00 AEDT). You can check the "Battle Tab" in your currency interface in-game to see the exact time till the next reset converted to your timezone:

![](/images/beginnersguide-reset.webp)

### Raid Loot Systems

Each raid type offers different types of loot.

| Content Type   | Reward                                                                                                        |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Savage Raids   | Offers the highest iLvl gear pieces for the current tier, plus material that will upgrade tome gear. More detail will be provided on Savage loot below. |
| Extreme Trials | Drops weapons or accessories (depending on the fight) suitable for pre-BiS gearsets. There is also a rare chance of a unique mount dropping. Once the trial is no longer 'current content,' the mount drop rate increases. Each clear provides 1-2 totems (amount depending on the fight) that can be exchanged for the gear that can drop in the fight. The mount is purchasable for 99 totems on the next major patch after release. There is no weekly limit to how many rewards you can obtain in Extreme trials. |
| Ultimate Raids | A clear gives 1 totem that can be exchanged for a cosmetic weapon. While the ultimate is current content, the weapon may be BiS and players are limited to 1 totem per week. This weekly cap is lifted on the next major patch after the ultimate's release. |
| Criterion Dungeons | Gives unique tokens that can be used for unique glamour pieces and other miscellaneous cosmetic / registrable items. The latest Endwalker Criterion Savage also provides cosmetic weapons. This is still relatively experimental content for the game, so a baseline for rewards is not set in stone. |
| Unreal Trials | A clear grants you a round of Faux Hollows (Faux Commander in Idyllshire at X:5.7 Y:6.1), a simple minigame where you uncover illustrations to receive Faux Leaves. You can play up to 2 rounds of Faux Hollows (i.e. 2 clears) per week. Note that you need to play the minigame before moving to your 2nd reclear (also known as a **retell**). Faux Leaves are a currency used to buy unique minions, mounts and glamour pieces. |

### Weekly Savage Lockouts

:::note
Don't confuse this term with 'instance timer lockout.'
:::

to be written

### Loot Order

If you are in a static, how loot is assigned every week is entirely up to the group. Some groups may choose to funnel gear to DPS, some groups try to evenly distribute gear between everyone. Just don't do any reclears outside of your static until the end of your scheduled week, otherwise you will screw over the rest of your team's potential loot for that week.

If you are in a PF and successfully clear a fight, there are 2 main ways to assign loot:
- L > R (left to right): only one item is rolled at a time, starting from the first (leftmost) loot in the list and going right. Players are only permitted to win 1 item - if you win an item, pass on the remaining loot.
- FFA (free for all): anyone is free to take anything.
