## What is High-End Raiding in FFXIV?

High-End Duty content in Final Fantasy XIV refers to the most challenging instanced encounters in the game, designed for experienced players seeking difficult mechanics and rewarding loot. In order of relative difficulty, these include:

- <span style="font-weight: 600; color: var(--color-other)">Unreal Trials:</span> Revamped versions of older extreme trials, adjusted to the current level cap.

- <span style="font-weight: 600; color: var(--color-chaotic)">Chaotic Raids:</span> Newer large-scale 24 man raids with complex mechanics based on older alliance raids.

- <span style="font-weight: 600; color: var(--color-extreme)">Extreme Trials:</span>: Tougher versions of standard trials, often featuring unique mechanics and valuable rewards.

- <span style="font-weight: 600; color: var(--color-savage)">Savage Raids:</span> Challenging versions of normal raids with complex mechanics and strict execution requirements.

- <span style="font-weight: 600; color: var(--color-criterion)">Criterion Dungeons^:</span> High-difficulty dungeon content with unique mechanics and a savage mode for special cosmetics.

- <span class="ultimate-text">Ultimate Raids:</span> The pinnacle of difficulty in FF14 raiding, extra-long boss roulettes requiring precision, practice, and persistence.

These duties typically release in cycles alongside major patches and expansions, offering powerful gear, titles, and cosmetic rewards. 
Players can tackle them via Party Finder or by joining a Static Group, which is a dedicated team that regularly raids together.

::: tip
If you are a new player who has never taken part in High-End Duty, we recommend starting with **Extreme** as this is the best entry point to learn new systems and mechanics in a lower-stress environment.

Extreme trials will introduce you to the basics of party roles, mechanics, and the terminology used in raiding. This will give you a taste of what to expect in Savage and Ultimate raiding.
:::

::: warning
As Unreal Trials and Chaotic Raids are generally more seasonal events, these are usually not considered an entry-point for new players getting into raiding and can be heavily cheesed.
:::

> ^Criterion Dungeons are not strictly raid content but function similarly to Savage Raids. They are designed for four players and have a normal and savage mode. The savage mode is considered high-end content and is similar in difficulty to Savage Raids.

### Release Cycle

High-End Duty content in Final Fantasy XIV follows a structured release cycle tied to major patches and expansions. Here's how it typically works:

| Content Type   | Release Cycle                                                                                                        |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Savage Raids   | Released two weeks after a new expansion or major patch, allowing players time to complete the normal version first. |
| Extreme Trials | Usually launched on day one of an expansion or major patch as these are tied to MSQ releases.                        |
| Ultimate Raids | Introduced several months after an expansion or major patch, Typically two ultimates will release per expansion.     |
| Criterion Dungeons | Added in mid-patches, offering a fresh challenge between major content updates. Unpredictable as they were only recently added in Endwalker. |
| Unreal Trials | Updated periodically with most major patches, replacing older trials with revamped versions. |

Savage Raids are the core of FF14 Raiding and release in three sets of four, known as **Tiers**. Each released on patch x.0, x.2, and x.4. Each Tier is made up of four Trial-like fights where you face off against a single boss.

::: tip SAVAGE NAMING
The FF14 community names savage fights using a **3-part naming scheme**. The prefix letter is unqiue to the Expansion Tier, the number refers to boss order from 1 to 12 and the last letter is always "S" for savage.

For example, the first fight in the Endwalker expansion is called "Pandaemonium: Asphodelos - The First Circle (Savage)" or "**P1S**". The second fight is called "**P2S**" and so on.
:::

::: tip PATCH NUMBERS
FF14 patch numbers are formatted as x.yz where x is the expansion number, y is the major patch number, and z is the minor patch number. For example, 6.4 was the fourth major patch of the Endwalker expansion. While 6.45 came out a few weeks later with extra content and some minor adjustments.

Major patches are released every 3–4 months and contain new content, story, and features. Minor patches are released every few weeks after a major patch to stagger the major patch content out over the patch cycle.
:::

### Rewards

High-End Duties in Final Fantasy XIV offer a variety of cosmetic and gear rewards depending on the type of content. You will find a detailed breakdown of the rewards for each type of content towards the [end of this guide](#rewards-1).

## Raiding Concepts

### Instances

Instances are the areas where you will be doing your High-End Duties. These are separate from the open world and are designed to be completed with a party of players. Instances are generally designed for 8 players, but some content may require more or less.

An instance will have a timer that will depend on the type of High-End Duty:

- Extreme/Unreal: **60 Minutes**
- Savage 1–3/Chaotic/Criterion Normal: **90 Minutes**
- Savage 4/Ultimate/Criterion Savage: **120 Minutes**

At the end of the timer, the instance will close, and you will be returned to the open world. This will boot you from an instance even if you are in combat.

Most groups refer to the full-timer duration as a "Lockout" and your static might say they are doing "2 lockouts" or "3 lockouts" of a fight. This means they are doing two or three full runs of the fight before calling it for the day.

::: tip NOTE
The "lockout" terminology is also used for the weekly lockout of savage raids and loot, which will be explained in more detail later. Beware of this and understand they are different things.
:::

### Phases

Phases are used to describe portions of a fight that have different mechanics or require different strategies. Savage fights will usually only have one phase except the last fight of a tier, which will have two distinct phases. Ultimate raids will generally have 5–6 phases, with each phase being like a mini-savage in itself.

Some raids will have a checkpoint where you can wipe and start future pulls from a later phase. These are most common in the last fight of a savage tier and are often referred to as "door bosses"

Phases are helpful for breaking down a fight into manageable chunks and allow you to focus on one part of the fight at a time. This is especially useful for new players who may be overwhelmed by the number of mechanics in a fight.

### Mechanics

Raid mechanics are the various abilities and attacks that bosses use during encounters. These mechanics can vary greatly from fight to fight, but there are some common mechanics that you will encounter in most high-end duties. Other mechanics are usually a combination of these common mechanics in unique ways.

| **Abbreviation**      | **Description** |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| **AoE**               | "Area-of-Effect" is a term often used to describe any mechanic or ability that impacts multiple enemies or players within a defined area. |
| **Stack/Soak**        | "Stack" or "Soak" refers to a mechanic that necessitates the party or a specific number of players to gather together in close proximity to share the damage inflicted by an attack or ability. |
| **Spread**            | "Spread" signifies a mechanic that requires party members to disperse and position themselves apart from each other to prevent overlapping damage or adverse effects. |
| **Telegraph/Broadcast** | "Telegraph" or "Broadcast" is a term used to describe the visual indicators displayed before a mechanic or ability activates. These indicators can include orange circles or lines on the ground, markers above player or enemy heads, or any other visual cue that signals an impending action. In more challenging content like Ultimates, some mechanics may not telegraph, necessitating players to rely on other cues such as cast bars. |
| **PB-AoE**            | "Point-Blank Area-of-Effect" typically denotes an enemy ability that generates a significant AoE damage area centered directly on the enemy itself. |
| **Chariot**           | "Chariot" describes a large circular AoE effect that encompasses the boss's immediate vicinity. |
| **Dynamo**            | "Dynamo" denotes a large donut-shaped AoE effect that surrounds the boss, with a safe zone in the center. |
| **Defamation**        | "Defamation" refers to a large circular AoE centered on a specific player, requiring nearby allies to react accordingly. |
| **Protean**           | "Protean" describes cone-shaped AoEs that target several or all players in a raid group, necessitating precise positioning and movement to avoid damage. |
| **Exaflare**          | "Exaflare" represents a mechanic involving delayed, sequential attacks that move in a specified direction. Typically, only the first explosion is visibly marked, requiring players to anticipate subsequent movements. |
| **Enums**             | "Enums" describe mechanics that require a specific number of players to participate in soaking the damage or effects. Similar to "Stack/Soak" mechanics, but with a predetermined player count involved. |


The glossary page has a list of common mechanics and descriptions, but we also suggest exploring the guides on this website to see some other examples of different mechanics.

### Burst/Pot Windows "2 mins"

Burst window is a term commonly used to refer to a period of time when the party aligns party buffs and cooldowns for maximum damage output. This is usually done at the start of a fight and at regular **2-minute intervals** throughout the encounter. Some jobs will also have a 1-minute burst window, but these are generally handled automatically between the 2-minute windows.

To get the most damage out of your job, you may hold some cooldowns to ensure they align for an upcoming burst window.

2-minute burst windows may be deliberately delayed to align with downtime or other mechanics, **it is important to communicate with your party about when these windows will occur**.

Potions (Pots) are consumables that temporarily increase your stats and will typically be used in line with the first burst window and the later usages will be delayed to align with another burst window later in the fight. Most savage raids will get at least two pot windows, with some fights and ultimates having three or more.

### Mitigations (Mits)

Damage mitigation is a crucial aspect of high-end raiding, as it helps reduce the amount of damage taken by the party during encounters and to survive certain mechanics.

- **Tank mits**: Tanks have a variety of abilities that can reduce damage taken by themselves and the party. Tanks will also need to coordinate their mitigations to deal with tank busters and other mechanics that require them to take significant damage alone.

- **Healer mits**: Healers have a number of raid-wide and targeted mitigations. Shield healers have the most options here, but all healers have some form of mit that can help the party.

- **DPS mits**: DPS roles have a number of targeted and party-wide mitigations such as Feint, Addle, and other job-specific abilities, these should be rotated through the fight to help reduce overall damage taken by the party. DPS mits are usually targeted at a foe and reduce the damage dealt rather than the damage taken.

- **Personal Defensives (Personals)**: Many jobs have personal defensive abilities that can be used to reduce individual damage taken. These should be used during high-damage phases or mechanics to help keep the player alive and reduce healer workload. Do not be afraid to use these, they are there to help you survive and keep the party alive. Your healers will appreciate it.

A Mit-plan is a plan that outlines when and how to use damage mitigation abilities during a fight. This can help ensure that the party is prepared for high-damage phases and can survive difficult mechanics. This can vary greatly with party composition and the fight itself, so it is important to discuss this with your party before the fight begins.

::: tip
**FFXIV Fight Line** is a great tool for creating a Mit-plan for your party. It allows you to create a timeline of the fight with premade templates of existing encounters. This can help ensure that everyone is on the same page and knows when to use their cooldowns.

### Macros

Macros are a way to automate certain actions in the game, such as using items or abilities. They are also often used to quickly share information with the party, such as strats. In Materia it is common practice to share a macro with the party at the start of a session to explain the strats the party plans to use.

```
■ Disco Inferno 1　　　■ Fixed A/B
　 G1 W | G2 E　　　　　　H1　T
■ Ensemble Assemble　　　　★
　 H1 MT ST H2　　　　　 Dps H2
　 D3 D1 D2 D4
■ Ride The Waves　 ■ Frogtourage
　 MT　H1　※Column 　D3  D4
　 D1　D3　T/M Inner　MT  ST　 D3MT  STD4
　 D2　D4　H/R Outer　D1  D2　H1D1  D2H2
　 ST　H2　　　　 　　 H1  H2
```

Macros are provided by many guide resources such as the Materia Raiding guides on this website.

### Waymarks

Waymarks are markers that can be placed on the ground to help players navigate and position themselves during encounters. They are often used in conjunction with macros to provide visual cues for mechanics or party positioning.

Waymarks are generally specific to a strategy and are generally provided alongside other resources such as in the raid guides provided by Materia Raiding.

![](/images/ex1-waymarks.webp)

These waymarks can be imported into the game using the Waymark Import addon, or you can ask a friend to import them for you and save a copy for yourself.

### Role Positions

There are a handful of default positions that are commonly used in raids and are a good starting point for new players to learn. These will often be mentioned in party discussions and guides.

#### Light Parties

Light parties are a way to describe the position of players in relation to two separate groups. This is commonly used in mechanics where the party must be split in half to perform a mechanic, the default light parties are:

- Light Party 1 (LP1): MT H1 D1 D3
- Light Party 2 (LP2): ST H2 D2 D4

#### Clock Spots

Clock spots are a way to describe the position of players in relation to a clock face. This is often used in mechanics where players need to spread out or stack together. The default clock spots are:

![](/images/beginnersguide-defaultpositions.webp)

These positions are in relation to the default clock-spot waymarks. These are use commonly and are a great way to also start blind-prog in any fight. All raiders should be aware of their default clock spots.

::: warning IMPORTANT
Beware there are variations of these positions for some fights due to specific mechanics, such as FRU where ST and H2 positions are swapped. It is important to check the fight guide for any specific changes to these positions.
:::

#### Color Partners

As an extension of clock spots, color partners are a way to describe the position of players in relation to each other. This is often used in mechanics where players need to spread out or stack together. The default color partners are based on your clock spots and the waymarks which are in the same positions (colors).

As per the image above, you will notice H1 and D1 are both in line with the Purple waymarks, this means they are color partners and will use these pairs for various mechanics.

- Red: MT D3
- Yellow: H2 D4
- Blue: ST D2
- Purple: H1 D1


## How to be a good Raider

Being a good raider is not just about knowing your job and mechanics, but also about being a good team player. This topic will get into some more advanced concepts, terminology, and tips that will help you become a better raider.

### Raid Etiquette

- **Be on time**: Be available at the agreed time. If you are running late, let your party know as soon as possible.

- **Communicate**: Use voice chat or text chat to communicate with your party. Let them know if you are having trouble with a mechanic or if you need help.

- **Be respectful**: Treat your party members with respect and kindness. Avoid being rude to others. Give everyone a chance to speak and share their thoughts. A healthy atmosphere is important for a successful raid.

- **Evaluate yourself regularly**: If you are consistently causing wipes or falling behind, it may be time to reevaluate your performance and ask for help. If you are not willing to improve, you may be blacklisted from future parties.

- **Be open to feedback**: If someone gives you constructive criticism, take it to heart and try to improve. Everyone makes mistakes, but it's important to learn from them.

- **Avoid getting tilted**: If you are having a bad day or are frustrated with the fight, take a break and come back when you are in a better mindset. Getting tilted can lead to further mistakes and frustration for everyone involved.

- **Prog Mentality**: Focus on learning a mechanic first before optimizing your DPS and rotation. Understanding and building confidence with a mechanic will lead towards better performance overall. This is especially important in savage and ultimate content where the mechanics are more complex and require more focus.

In smaller communities, bad behavior can lead to being blacklisted from future parties. Admitting fault and apologizing can go a long way in repairing relationships. If you are blacklisted, it may be difficult to find parties in the future.

### Understanding your Job

#### GCDs and Uptime/Downtime

Rule no.1 is "Always be Casting" or keep your GCD rolling. This means you want to always keep your GCD "spinning". Any time your GCD is not moving is considered downtime and should be avoided. Using the correct GCD abilities comes next and this is your "rotation". 

Uptime is the effective time you are able to deal damage during an encounter and keep your GCD rolling. Managing uptime will lead to better overall damage output and can involve multiple factors such as:

- **Positioning**: Make sure you are in the right position to achieve positionals and stay in range of the boss, this is especially important for melee DPS jobs. If you are a ranged DPS or healer, make sure you are in range of the boss and other party members.

- **Forced Downtime**: Many encounters will have downtime periods where the boss is not targetable or is moving around the arena. Make sure you are aware of these periods and adjust your rotation accordingly, this may involve using non-damaging abilities to fill the gaps or ranged attacks to maintain uptime.

- **Cast Times**: If you are a Caster or Healer, keep in mind your movement speed and cast time. Make sure you can avoid mechanics while still dealing damage.

::: tip SLIDECASTING
Slide-casting is a technique used by casters to move while casting spells. When casting an ability that requires you to stand still, you can safely move within the last 0.5 seconds of the cast duration. This will not cancel the cast and can help you maintain uptime while avoiding mechanics. For Casters, it is important to practice this technique to ensure you can use it effectively in raids.

This works due to server-side snapshots where the game has effectively already "finished" the cast when the GCD has less than approx 0.5s remaining. This window will be ping-independent and may vary from player to player.

![](/images/beginnersguide-slidecast.webp)

This image shows an example of the slide-cast window, moving when the cast is within the last 0.5 seconds will not cancel the cast.
:::

#### Rotation and Burst Windows

Your rotation is made up of three components: your opener, your core rotation, and your burst window. The opener is the order of actions and cooldowns you will use from the beginning of the fight, while the core rotation is the order of abilities you will use throughout the fight.

Your burst windows are the periods of time when you will use your abilities and cooldowns to maximize your damage output. These are usually aligned with the party's burst windows and are generally on a 2-minute cycle from the start of the fight.

The best resource for learning your job is [The Balance Discord](https://discord.com/invite/thebalanceffxiv). This is a community of players who share information about job rotations, openers, and performance analysis. Here you will find comprehensive guides for all jobs and their rotations.

<Action title='Visit the Balance' color='yellow' href='https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/' />``

#### Utilities

Certain jobs have utility abilities that can be used to help the party or themselves. These can be unique tools specific to certain jobs or common utilities found across a role. The core utilities are:

- **Resurrections**: These are abilities that allow healers and some caster jobs to revive fallen party members. These have no cooldown but have a long cast time and are expensive on mana. Players revived by a healer will have a debuff that also significantly reduces their damage output.
- **Tank Invulnerability**: Each tank has an ability that allows them to temporarily mitigate any amount of damage for a short period of time, these have a very long cooldown and work slightly differently for each tank job.
- **Rescue**: Healers all have a rescue ability that allows them to pull a party member to their location. A good healer can use this to save another party member from a mistake or quickly reposition them for a mechanic.
- **Gap Closers**: These are movement abilities that allow players to quickly close the gap between them and the boss. This is especially important for melee DPS jobs who need to be in range of the boss to deal damage.


### Reviewing your performance

After each raid, take some time to review your performance. This can help you identify areas where you can improve and become a better raider. Here are some tools you can use to review your performance:

- **Stone, Sky and Sea**: This is a built-in tool in the game that allows you to review your damage performance against a target dummy with similar checks to a savage raid fight. if you can kill it, use the time left on the encounter as a gauge of your damage. If you can't kill it, you might need to work on fixing your rotation and burst window usage. If you can effectively pass the SSS trials with plenty time to spare, you are likely ready to tackle the damage requirements for the fight. You can find out how to unlock this content [here](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Stone,_Sky,_Sea).

- **Record Yourself**: Recording your gameplay can help you identify areas where you can improve. You can use software like OBS or Shadowplay to record your gameplay and then review it later.

- **The Balance**: [The Balance Discord](https://discord.com/invite/thebalanceffxiv) is a community of players who share information about job rotations, strategies, and performance analysis. You can ask for help with your rotation or performance in the individual job-specific question channels.

::: warning Third-Party Tools
Some of these tools are considered third-party tools and may violate the Terms of Service of Final Fantasy XIV. Use them at your own discretion.
:::

- [FFLogs](https://www.fflogs.com/): A popular tool for analyzing raid performance. FFLogs allows you to see in-depth statistics about your performance, key areas to look for are:
  - rDPS: This is the damage you dealt including all damage due to buffs you provided other players.
  - uptime: This is the amount of time you were able to deal damage during the fight and keep your GCD rolling.

- [Xivanalysis](https://xivanalysis.com/): Used with FFLogs, XIVanalysis is a tool that provides detailed analysis of your logs. You can see how you performed in different areas, such as uptime, rotational mistakes, buff usage, and more.

::: warning Note
FFLogs requires someone in the party to be using the ACT (Advanced Combat Tracker) app to export logs and FFLogs Uploader app to upload them. This is not a requirement for all parties, but it is a good idea to ask if you are in a static or log for yourself if you are in a PF.

[How to get started with FFLogs in FFXIV](https://www.fflogs.com/help/start)
:::

### Understanding the Game Systems

Understanding the games' engine and combat system can have a large impact on your performance; 

- **GCD**: The Global Cooldown is the time it takes for your character to perform an action. Most jobs will run a GCD speed close to the default value of 2.5 seconds, however, some jobs either have passive skills or use Skill Speed, Spell Speed, or Food to lower this value. Understanding how the GCD works and how to optimize it is crucial for maximizing your damage output.

- **oGCD**: Off Global Cooldown abilities are abilities that do not trigger the GCD and can be used at any time. These abilities can be used to fill the gaps while you wait for the GCS to come back up. Using oGCD abilities between GCDs is called "**Weaving**" and is a key part of maximizing your damage output. You can typically fit 2 oGCDs in between each GCD, but this can vary depending on your job and the abilities you are using. This would be called "**Double Weaving**".

::: tip
You will notice all skills in the game are labelled as "Weaponskill", "Spell" or "Ability".

- **Weaponskills** and **Spells** are on the GCD
- **Abilities** are oGCD.
:::

- **Queueing & Clipping**: The game allows you to queue up your next ability while the GCD is still on cooldown. This means you can press your next ability before the GCD is finished, and it will automatically trigger when the GCD is over. The queue window is about 0.5s before the end of the GCD cooldown. This is important for maintaining a smooth rotation and avoiding clipping. The queue is server-side, which means that the ability occurs instantly after the GCD finishes which allows you to achieve zero downtime between abilities. Most abilities can be queued, however, some abilities cannot be queued and will require you to wait for the GCD to finish before using them. The delay that occurs after the GCD finishes and when the next input is registered on the server is called "**Clipping**" and can lead to a loss of damage if not managed properly.

- **Snapshots**: Snapshots are a reference to how the game handles events from the server-side, the game bundles events together every few seconds and processes them as a batch. This can result in some unexpected behaviours when using certain abilites or most commonly when avoiding mechanics. You might visually avoid or dodge a mechanic before the visual indicator ends however if the game has already processed the event, you will still take damage.

Some plugins can help with common issues with latency and clipping. These can help greatly with tight DPS rotations when you have high ping or are on a low-end PC. These plugins are not required but can help with your performance.

- NoClippy: A plugin that helps with clipping issues by adjusting your GCD and ability timings. This can help you maintain a smoother rotation and avoid clipping abilities on high-latency connections.

## Preparation

Prior to instancing into a raid, there are several things you need to prepare for - gear, consumables, knowing your class's general rotation, and studying for the encounter you intend to do (unless you have joined a "blind" PF or static).

### Gear and Melding

If you are raiding at the beginning of a tier, you want to be wielding the newest crafted gear that is overmelded with 5 materia. You may have some pieces from the extreme / normal raid, and as you obtain tome and raid gear you can replace the lower iLvl piece. You must ensure your gear is fully melded before joining a raid party in PF.

[The Balance Discord](https://discord.com/invite/thebalanceffxiv) will provide you with information on your job's Week 1 BiS, as well as the final raid BiS.

::: tip
BiS or Best-In-Slot gear is the best possible gear you can obtain for your job at a given time. This is usually determined by the community and is often updated with new patches. There are typically multiple BiS sets for a job, depending on the player's preferred GCD timing.
:::

To obtain crafted gear: you can craft it yourself, buy it off the Market Board, or have someone else craft it for you.

Overmelding is a process that allows you to add additional materia to your gear beyond the normal limit of 2 and is only available for crafted gear. This is important for maximizing your stats and performance in high-end content for early prog. The first 2 meld slots are guaranteed, but the 3rd, 4th, and 5th slots are not guaranteed and can fail.

To overmeld your gear:
- You must have 1 Disciple of the Hand (crafter) job at max level as this allows you to meld your own gear.
- You must complete this [full quest chain](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Forging_the_Spirit) that eventually teaches overmelding.

OR

- You can borrow the services of a crafter who has already unlocked overmelding themselves. Be sure to give them a tip for their time and effort.

As overmelding gear is a gambling process, you will need a lot of materia. Regularly attending A rank hunt trains (which you can track in the [Faloop Discord](https://discord.com/invite/faloop)) is the best way to obtain clusters (which you exchange for materia). Otherwise, your other immediate option is to buy them from the Market Board, which becomes expensive very quickly.

If for some reason you absolutely cannot achieve Week 1 BiS and intend on doing early prog:
- If you are in a static, let them know. How they choose to handle that is up to the static.
- If you intend to PF, please respect other people's time and do not join parties with undergeared and unmelded jobs. People want to give themselves the best chance to progress and having bad gear will undermine that.

If you begin raiding later in the tier, as long as you are fully melded with current tome, crafted or normal raid gear, that is acceptable.

### Consumables

You must have current high-quality food up and running during a raid. Food buffs give you extra health and a boost in 2 specific stats - they last 30 minutes (40 with FC buffs and 45 with a manual). The ideal food for your job is information available on The Balance Discord.

You must also carry current high-quality potions with you. For extreme and savage, you are not expected to use them during early prog and can save them for final mech prog / A2C / reclears. For ultimates, especially on-content encounters, it is expected that pots are used even during prog at specific points to meet a phase's DPS check. Individual encounters may have unique pot windows but in general, use them when available at the beginning of a 2-minute burst window. At the time of writing, the current pots are called "Grade 3 Gemdraught of X" and can be crafted by alchemists or bought from the market board.

**People can see if you are not using your consumables so don't try to get away with this.**

You can craft these consumables yourself, have someone else craft them for you or buy them from the Market Board.

### Studying

If there are resources available and agreed strategies to solve mechanics for a particular encounter, it is paramount to be familiar with them before instancing into the encounter. Of course, it is normal to make mistakes while practicing physically executing the mechanic, but do not come into raid without having an idea what you are supposed to do.

Your static may provide you with the resources you need for studying, but many statics try to match PF strategies for compatability. For PF strategies, the [Materia Raiding Website](https://materiaraiding.com/) has resources including raidplans / toolboxes (visual diagrams of how to resolve a mechanic).

::: warning
If you are jumping into PF week 1, **expect strats to change multiple times** and regularly check the Materia Raiding Website/Discord until strategies are 100% set in stone.
:::

Studying goes beyond simply looking at raidplans - POVs are essential to put these diagrams into context. Do your best to also understand *why* the mechanic plays out - having a proper understanding of the mechanic (as opposed to looking at the raidplan purely to understand where to stand) will make you a better and more competent raider. As mentioned before, it is disrespectful to other party members and their time to show up underprepared so please study adequately.

How much you need to study depends on the encounter itself or static expectations. Generally speaking, you want to study *at least* 1 phase ahead of your prog point. Again, the definition of a phase will depend on the encounter itself, but just study as much as possible!

The only exception to a study requirement is if you are in a blind PF or static (i.e. the party intends to solve the encounter themselves without any resources)

## Finding a Party

There are two ways you can get a party together for High-End Duty content. 

- **Form a Static**: A group of players who raid together on a regular schedule with the same roster.
- **Use Party Finder**: Temporary improvised parties formed using the in-game party finder tool.

There are pros and cons to both approaches; this will ultimately depend on your own availability, commitment, and goals.

### What is a Static?

A Static is a dedicated group of players who regularly play together to tackle high-end content like Savage Raids, Criterion Dungeons, and Ultimate Raids. Instead of relying on Party Finder, **statics provide a consistent team with established schedules, strategies, and goals**.

Statics are generally only used for the most challenging High-End Duties, as these do require consistency and regular practice to clear reliably. Most Statics will form a few weeks or months prior to the release of a new Savage Raid tier or Ultimate.

A static might follow the regions standard strats or may use their own developed strats for a fight, this will depend on when they progged the fight.

A static is generally considered the **fastest way to clear a tier** and can also guarantee you will get all the loot you need eventually as your team can target loot to players strategically.

::: tip
The best way to find a static is to join your regions party-finder discord servers.

For Materia Players, use the [Materia Raiding Discord](https://discord.gg/EySn5dRj65) and check the following channels:

- **#looking-for-members**: Groups that are advertising open spots for members to join.
- **#looking-for-group**: Players advertising they are looking for a static to join.

#### Managing expectations

When setting up a Static, the most important thing to do is to ensure all members have the same expectations for the party. Static groups are generally classified as either Casual, Midcore, or Hardcore groups, with vastly different expectations of time commitment, skill level, and work.

Statics often fall apart when groups don't communicate the expectations properly beforehand.

### Party Finder

Party Finder is an in-game tool that can be a useful tool for finding a group, depending on your region. Party finder lets you advertise a party for a specific duty, and players can join your party if they meet the requirements. This is a great way to find groups for high-end content if you are looking for a more casual experience.

To find the right group, it is important to understand the terminology that is often used for Party Finder listings:

| Terminology        | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Fresh**          | This group is starting the fight or mechanic fresh and is open to unexperienced players                                                                                                 |
| "mech" **Prog**    | This group is currently progging a specific mechanic and looking for other players to also learn this mechanic and prog past it.                                                        |
| "mech" **Cleanup** | This group is looking finish progging a specific mechanic and are looking for players up to the same point in the fight. Do not join if you have not learnt this specific mechanic yet. |
| **A2C**            | This group has progged all the mechanics and are looking for players who are ready to clear the fight, do not join if you are still progging mechanics.                                 |
| **C41/C4x**        | This group is doing a clear of the fight with only 1 or X players who have not cleared before.                                                                                          |
| **Blind**          | This group is not studying the fight and going in without any prior knowledge, let them work it out themselves.                                                                         |
| **Need WM/Macro**  | This group is looking for someone who can bring their own Macros or Waymarks to share with the group                                                                                    |
| **MR Strat**       | This group is using strats specifically from "Materia Raiding" community, this might be replaced with other strat names                                                                 |
| **3x runs**        | This group is looking to kill the boss a certain number of times to farm loot, often seen with extreme trials                                                                           |

::: danger WARNING
Do not join a party for content you have not progressed up to yet, joining groups beyond your current prog point will inevitably cause unnecessary wipes, waste others' time and could harm your reputation within the raiding community.

## Rewards

Many loot rewards from various battle content have weekly limits. For reference, these weekly limits reset every **Tuesday UTC+00:00** (18:00 AEST | 19:00 AEDT). You can check the "Battle Tab" in your currency interface in-game to see the exact time till the next reset converted to your timezone:

### Raid Loot Systems

Each raid type offers different types of loot.

| Content Type   | Reward                                                                                                        |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Savage Raids   | Offers the highest iLvl gear pieces for the current tier, plus material that will upgrade tome gear. More detail will be provided on Savage loot below. |
| Extreme Trials | Drops weapons or accessories (depending on the fight) suitable for pre-BiS gearsets. There is also a rare chance of a unique mount dropping. Once the trial is no longer 'current content,' the mount drop rate increases. Each clear provides 1-2 totems (amount depending on the fight) that can be exchanged for the gear that can drop in the fight. The mount is purchasable for 99 totems on the next major patch after release. There is no weekly limit to how many rewards you can obtain in Extreme trials. |
| Ultimate Raids | A clear gives 1 totem that can be exchanged for a cosmetic weapon. While the ultimate is current content, the weapon may be BiS and players are limited to 1 totem per week. This weekly cap is lifted on the next major patch after the ultimate's release. |
| Criterion Dungeons | Gives unique tokens that can be used for unique glamour pieces and other miscellaneous cosmetic / registrable items. The latest Endwalker Criterion Savage also provides cosmetic weapons. This is still relatively experimental content for the game, so a baseline for rewards is not set in stone. |
| Unreal Trials | A clear grants you a round of Faux Hollows (Faux Commander in Idyllshire at X:5.7 Y:6.1), a simple minigame where you uncover illustrations to receive Faux Leaves. You can play up to 2 rounds of Faux Hollows (i.e. 2 clears) per week. Note that you need to play the minigame before moving to your 2nd reclear (also known as a **retell**). Faux Leaves are a currency used to buy unique minions, mounts and glamour pieces. |

### Weekly Savage Lockouts

::: tip NOTE
Don't confuse this term with 'instance timer lockout.'
:::

When you clear a savage raid boss, your party will recieve a number of loot items based on how many party members were eligible for loot.

- 8 players = 4 loot items
- 4-7 players = 2 loot items
- 1-3 players = no loot

Each player character is **eligible for loot once per week per savage boss**. You can repeat the fight as many times as you like, but **you will reduce the amount of loot that drops for the party,** and you are ineligible to receive any loot after your first kill of the week.

You should aim to clear each boss with a full party of **8 eligible players to maximise loot**.

You will also receive one **"book"** per week for each boss you kill regardless of lockout. Multiple books can be exchanged for a raid drop of your choice from a vendor in one of the expansion cities.

Each boss in a savage tier must also be cleared to receive the weekly loot. If you join a party on a later boss, you relinquish your eligibility for a book and loot on the previous bosses.

::: tip
Some groups will do "book runs" at the end of the week to get a book regardless of loot eligibility. This is a great way to help get your weekly book if you are having trouble finding a full party in PF
:::

The weekly savage loot lockout is removed towards the end of the major patch cycle, allowing players to farm the savage raid for loot without any restrictions.


### Loot Order

If you are in a static, how loot is assigned every week is entirely up to the group. Some groups may choose to funnel gear to DPS, some groups try to evenly distribute gear between everyone. Just don't do any reclears outside of your static until the end of your scheduled week, otherwise you will screw over the rest of your team's potential loot for that week.

If you are in a PF and successfully clear a fight, there are 2 main ways to assign loot:
- **L > R** (left to right): only one item is rolled at a time, starting from the first (leftmost) loot in the list and going right. Players are only permitted to win 1 item - if you win an item, pass on the remaining loot and leave the instance.
- **FFA** (free for all): anyone is free to take anything.
