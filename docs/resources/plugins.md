# Plugins

::: warning
Plugins are against the Terms of Service of Final Fantasy XIV. While they are not policed by Square Enix, using them is at your own risk. We do not encourage the use of botting, automation or any plugin that gives you an unfair advantage over other players.
:::

Plugins are third-party tools that can enhance your FFXIV experience, providing additional features and quality-of-life improvements. However, they are not officially supported by Square Enix and can potentially lead to account penalties if misused.

Some plugins are generally accepted by the community, such as simple quality-of-life improvements: 

- **Waymark Import Plugin** - Allows you to import waymarks from various sources directly into your game.
- **NoClippy** - A plugin that fixes many issues with the game's combat queueing and reduces the chance of actions being dropped.
- **[MacroMate](/resources/macromate)** - A plugin that allows you to access macros directly from external sources like the Materia Raiding website, making it easier to find and use macros for various encounters.

## Setting up Plugins

The safest way to setup and use plugins is through the [FFXIVQuickLauncher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher), this launcher installs **Dalamud**, a plugin framework that allows you to install and manage plugins easily.

1. Download the [FFXIVQuickLauncher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher/releases) from the latest release page.
2. Install the launcher by running the downloaded executable.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up the launcher, including selecting your FFXIV installation directory.
4. Launch FFXIV through the FFXIVQuickLauncher. Make sure **Dalamud** is enabled in the launcher settings.

Once you have the launcher installed, you can access the Dalamud Plugins list from the Start menu in-game.
