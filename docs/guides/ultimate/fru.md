This guide will be written using prog strats and is mainly an explanation of how mechanics work and their failure conditions.
This guide will be updated as strats are standardised in the OCE community, everything is subject to change.

### Buff Timings

## Phase 1: Fatebreaker

Throughout this phase Fatebreaker will aspect his abilities with either Fire or Lightning.

Fire **Cyclonic Break**
: Role-based partner stack.

Lightning **Cyclonic Break**
: Large spread AOEs on each player.

Fire **Strike Break**
: Very strong knockback after the initial hit.

Lightning **Strike Break**
: Line AOE expanding to 2x it's width after the initial hit.

After a few heavy hitting auto attacks, Fatebreaker will cast **Cyclonic Break** which will target each player with proteans.
These proteans will repeat in the position they are baited, and then alternate to the previous safe spot twice.

For **Fire Aspected** Cyclonic Break, each player will rotate into a pair stack, then alternating between proteans.

For **Lightning Aspected** Cyclonic Break each player will move into the same proteans but with ranged behind the melee for spreads, then alternate between proteans.

After this resolves, Fatebreaker will cast **Powder Mark Trail**, hitting the MT with a heavy tankbuster and marking them with a 15s debuff of the same name.

Once this debuff falls off, the marked player and the closest ally to them will take a small circular AOE tankbuster.

After the initial hit of **Powder Mark Trail**, Fatebreaker will cast the trio of this phase:

### Utopian Sky

This mechanic can be Fire or Lightning aspected. Fire will result in 2 light party stacks targeted on each healer, and Lightning will result in large AOEs on each player.

Fatebreaker will go untargetable and jump away as fog fills the arena. Party members will spread to the wall in protean positions with ST and D4 swapped. ST and MT will resolve their Powder Mark by moving slightly closer together at the wall.

While at the wall, 3 clones will raise their arms. Any clone with an arm raised with dash through the arena in a large cleave. The players who's clones arms have raised will walk into the center of the arena, and any player directly opposite them will also walk in. 
This will result in 2 people remaining on the wall and subsequently form a small triangular safe spot. 

After arriving at the safespot, the party will either stack or spread. The spread is identical to **Strength** from DSR. 
The DPS can move 3.5 notches from the star on the arena edge to determine a safe distance from the healer.

### Tethers 1

After the spreads or stacks resolve, Fatebreaker will drop into the middle of the room **untargetable** and begin to cast another aspected Cyclonic Break. Another Lightning Aspected Fatebreaker clone will spawn on the West of the arena casting Strike Break. As the proteans resolve, another clone will spawn in the middle of the arena that is either Fire or Lightning Aspected. What is **NOT** aspected here will be the safespot in the upcoming mechanic.

Immediately following the Cyclonic Break, players will either move North or South to avoid the Strike Break. To the north, a Fire Aspected clone will begin to cast Strike Break. At the same time, two random players will be targeted for light party stacks via a **Bound of Faith** cast. 

Light party 1 will move slightly to the north, and Light party 2 will move slightly to the south. If a swap is required, melee will flex as needed. Using the knock back from Strike Break, each party will be knocked North East/West and South East/West depending where the safespot is.

If these light parties are not an even 4/4 split, players will be hit with a heavy damage down.

Fatebreaker will then appear in the center of the arena and cast "Burnished Glory", a hard hitting raidwide with a bleed attached.

Following this, Fatebreaker casts:

### Fall of Faith / Tethers 2

Fatebreaker will begin the mechanic by targeting a random player with either a **Fire Aspected** or **Lightning Aspected** Fall of Faith.

3 clones will spawn from NW to NE, each one tethering a new player with Fire/Lightning.

These tethers are slightly different to the previous Bound of Faith mechanics in that **Fire** tethers will launch a large conal light party stack at the nearest player, whilst **Lightning** tethers will launch 3 large conal AOEs on the nearest players.

To resolve this, the party will line up south of Fatebreaker. As the tethers are placed, the 1st and 3rd tether will go to the West of Fatebreaker, and 2nd and 4th tether players will go to the East of Fatebreaker.
The remaining players will split evenly so West/East both have 4 players.
